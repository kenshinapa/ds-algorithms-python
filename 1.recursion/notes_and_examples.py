"""I'll create examples and add notes as comments while I'm learning recursion.

Notes:
    When to use recursion:
        - When we can easily breakdown a problem into smaller similar sub-problems.
        - When we are fine with extra overhead (both time and space) that comes with it.
        - When we need a quick working solution instead of efficient one.
        - When traverse a tree or graph.
        - When we use memoization in recursion.

    When not to use recursion:
        - If time and space complexity matters for us.
        - Recursion uses more memory. If we use embedded memory. For example an application that
        takes more memory in the phone is not efficient.
        - Recursion canb be slow.
